	entry 0 - getting started - sep 25, 2016<br><br>
	i actually had a bit of difficulty getting started!
	my biggest struggle was just getting this website up and hosted.
	i took to piazza and asked a bunch of questions. turned out my public_html folder was locked up.
	i didn't learn any general skills from this assignment really. i already have some decent experience in html.
	for example, i already knew about tagging, inline style, and the like - the basics of making an html document.
	oh that reminds me, i actually have css even though the assignment said it isn't needed. i knew how to do it so i decided to just go ahead with it, since i wanted my website to look nice.
	most of it is in an external file (style.css), but i have a few inline ones, such as padding on the kitten picture.
	even if i didn't learn much new, the assignment was wonderful for refreshing myself, as it's been a number of years since i really sat down and did html programming.
	of course, i learned how to host on onid. i definitely knew nothing about that beforehand, which is why i had so much trouble getting this set up.
	seems like i have to manually set permissions for <em>every</em> file i add. they never have public read and execute permissions. perhaps there's a way to set that up?...<br><br>
	i bent the rules a bit on this first assignment and put together my whole website with an index and everything for getting around to all my assignments.
	it opens up some nice options for adding more stuff here in the future. just thinking ahead i guess.
	it does make my github submission a bit more confusing, though.<br><br>
	i got help with this assignment on the piazza forum, along with some random stack overflow help pages, such as one that helped me set the margin of the website so it can look nice and compact.
	it's a style i like for little personal websites like this.
	as a side note, i hope the all-lower-case typing i'm using here isn't awful to look at! it's just something i like. anywhere else i type professionally. <br><br>
	anyways, that's it for now. looking forward to the rest of the class.<br>
