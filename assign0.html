	<p>for this assignment, i'll be introducing myself a bit...</p>
	<ul>
	<li>i'm james barry! just call me james.</li>
	<li>i'm majoring in computer science, and in my second year of study.<br>i'm planning on graduating in 2019.</li>
	<li>on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being no skill and 10 being a master, i'd say i have a 5 in html skill.<br>
	i took an html class in high school, and make custom css sometimes as a sort of hobby.<br>
	i was able to put together this website without any outside help.<br>
	i did need some help getting this all hosted on the school server, but that's more ssh skill than html.</li>
	<li>in this class, i hope to really cement my ability to put together a website.<br>
	i already have some html experience, but i'd like to refresh and grow!</li>
	<li>i've signed up for piazza.<br>
	i got help with setting up my webspace there.</li>
	<li>as for an interesting fact about me,<br>
	i have a lot of weird teeth problems.<br>
	my two front teeth are partially fake. i broke them when i was 10 or so.<br>
	i still have two baby teeth. no adult teeth exist to replace them, so they haven't fallen out.<br>
	i also only have two wisdom teeth. i'll have to get them pulled soon, or they'll grow out indefinitely.<br>
	wisdom teeth are very tall and need something to push up against to stop them from growing out more.<br>
	both are on top, so there's no bottom wisdom teeth to stop them.</li>
	<li>and as for a picture of myself, i'm not really comfortable posting that online.<br>
	i have that kitty up there, so you know i can insert an image at least.<br>
	i hope you understand, and i'm sorry!</li>
	</ul>
